# MachineLearningProject
* I completed this project for my PSTAT 131[Statistical Machine Learning] class in Spring of 2020. This was completed with my partner, Tejal Kolte. 
* The data set we used in our analysis is the “Banknote Authentication Data Set” from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. 
* This data was extracted in order to evaluate an authentication procedure for banknotes, and the data set contains information regarding different features of authentic and forged banknotes.
* The principal goal of our analysis is to determine how these variables can be used to predict the authenticity of a banknote and use supervised learning to develop the best binary classifier for such a prediction. We also aim to find the relative importance of each of these variables.
* Machine Learning Methods (using R):
  1. k-Nearest Neighbors
  2. Decision Trees (Classification Trees)
  3. Bagging
  4. Random Forest
